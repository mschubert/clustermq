ClusterMQ: send R function calls as cluster jobs
================================================

This package will allow you to send function calls as jobs on a computing
cluster with a minimal interface provided by the `Q` function:

```r
# load the library and create a simple function
library(clustermq)
fx = function(x) x * 2

# queue the function call on your scheduler
Q(fx, x=1:3, n_jobs=1)
# list(2,4,6)
```

Computations are done [entirely on the network](https://github.com/armstrtw/rzmq)
and without any temporary files on network-mounted storage, so there is no
strain on the file system apart from starting up R once per job. All
calculations are load-balanced, i.e. workers that get their jobs done faster
will also receive more function calls to work on. This is especially useful if
not all calls return after the same time, or one worker has a high load.

Installation
------------

First, we need the [ZeroMQ](https://github.com/ropensci/rzmq#installation)
system library. Most likely, your package manager will provide this:

```sh
# You can skip this step on Windows and macOS, the rzmq binary has it
# On a computing cluster, we recommend to use Conda or Linuxbrew
brew install zeromq # Linuxbrew, Homebrew on macOS
conda install zeromq # Conda
sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev # Ubuntu
sudo yum install zeromq-devel # Fedora
pacman -S zeromq # Arch Linux
```

Then install the `clustermq` package in R (which automatically installs the
`rzmq` package as well) from CRAN:

```r
install.packages('clustermq')
```

Alternatively you can use `devtools` to install directly from Github:

```r
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('mschubert/clustermq')
# devtools::install_github('mschubert/clustermq', ref="develop") # dev version
```

Schedulers
----------

An HPC cluster's scheduler ensures that computing jobs are distributed to
available worker nodes. Hence, this is what clustermq interfaces with in order
to do computations.

We currently support the [following
schedulers](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/articles/userguide.html#setting-up-the-scheduler)
(either locally or via SSH):

* [LSF](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/articles/userguide.html#lsf) - *should work without setup*
* [SGE](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/articles/userguide.html#sge) - *should work without setup*
* [SLURM](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/articles/userguide.html#slurm) - *should work without setup*
* [PBS](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/articles/userguide.html#pbs)/[Torque](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/articles/userguide.html#torque) - *needs* `options(clustermq.scheduler="PBS"/"Torque")`
* via [SSH](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/articles/userguide.html#ssh-connector) -
*needs* `options(clustermq.scheduler="ssh", clustermq.ssh.host=<yourhost>)`

Each scheduler will be interfaced [using a default template that can be customized.](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/articles/userguide.html
)

If you need specific [computing environments or
containers](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/articles/userguide.html#environments),
you can activate them via the scheduler template.

Usage
-----

The most common arguments for `Q` are:

 * `fun` - The function to call. This needs to be self-sufficient (because it
        will not have access to the `master` environment)
 * `...` - All iterated arguments passed to the function. If there is more than
        one, all of them need to be named
 * `const` - A named list of non-iterated arguments passed to `fun`
 * `export` - A named list of objects to export to the worker environment

The documentation for other arguments can be accessed by typing `?Q`. Examples
of using `const` and `export` would be:

```r
# adding a constant argument
fx = function(x, y) x * 2 + y
Q(fx, x=1:3, const=list(y=10), n_jobs=1)
```

```r
# exporting an object to workers
fx = function(x) x * 2 + y
Q(fx, x=1:3, export=list(y=10), n_jobs=1)
```

`clustermq` can also be used as a parallel backend for
[`foreach`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=foreach). As this is also
used by [`BiocParallel`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocParallel.html),
we can run those packages on the cluster as well:

```r
library(foreach)
register_dopar_cmq(n_jobs=2, memory=1024) # accepts same arguments as `workers`
foreach(i=1:3) %dopar% sqrt(i) # this will be executed as jobs
```

```r
library(BiocParallel)
register(DoparParam()) # after register_dopar_cmq(...)
bplapply(1:3, sqrt)
```

More examples are available in [the
user guide](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/articles/userguide.html).

Comparison to other packages
----------------------------

There are some packages that provide high-level parallelization of R function calls
on a computing cluster. We compared `clustermq` to `BatchJobs` and `batchtools` for
processing many short-running jobs, and found it to have approximately 1000x less
overhead cost.

In short, use `clustermq` if you want:

* a one-line solution to run cluster jobs with minimal setup
* access cluster functions from your local Rstudio via SSH
* fast processing of many function calls without network storage I/O

Use [`batchtools`](https://github.com/mllg/batchtools) if you:

* want to use a mature and well-tested package
* don't mind that arguments to every call are written to/read from disc
* don't mind there's no load-balancing at run-time

Use [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or
[`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) if:

* you want to design and run a workflow on HPC

Don't use [`batch`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/batch/index.html)
(last updated 2013) or [`BatchJobs`](https://github.com/tudo-r/BatchJobs)
(issues with SQLite on network-mounted storage).

## Installation

### ZeroMQ

The `rzmq` package (which this package depends on) needs the system library
ZeroMQ.

```{sh eval=FALSE}
# You can skip this step on Windows and macOS, the rzmq binary has it
brew install zeromq # Linuxbrew, Homebrew on macOS
conda install zeromq # Conda
sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev # Ubuntu
sudo yum install zeromq3-devel # Fedora
pacman -S zeromq # Arch Linux
```

More details can be found at the [rzmq project
README](https://github.com/ropensci/rzmq#installation).

### R package

The latest stable version is available [on
CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=clustermq).

Alternatively, it is also available on the
[`master`](https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq) branch of the repository.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# from CRAN
install.packages('clustermq')

# from Github
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('mschubert/clustermq')
```

In the [`develop`](https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq/tree/develop) branch,
we will introduce code changes and new features. These may contain bugs, poor
documentation, or other inconveniences. This branch may not install at times.
However, [feedback is very
welcome](https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq/issues/new).

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('mschubert/clustermq', ref="develop")
```

## Configuration

### Setting up the scheduler

An HPC cluster's scheduler ensures that computing jobs are distributed to
available worker nodes. Hence, this is what `clustermq` interfaces with in
order to do computations.

By default, we will take whichever scheduler we find and fall back on local
processing. This will work in most, but not all cases.

To set up a scheduler explicitly,  see the following links:

* [LSF](#LSF)
* [SGE](#SGE)
* [Slurm](#SLURM)
* [Torque](#Torque)
* [PBS](#PBS)
* if you want another scheduler, [open an
  issue](https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq/issues/new)

### SSH connector

There are reasons why you might prefer to not to work on the computing cluster
directly but rather on your local machine instead.
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is an excellent local IDE, it's more
responsive than and feature-rich than browser-based solutions ([RStudio
server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/), [Project
Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)), and it avoids X forwarding issues when you want
to look at plots you just made.

Using this setup, however, you lost access to the computing cluster. Instead,
you had to copy your data there, and then submit individual scripts as jobs,
aggregating the data in the end again. `clustermq` is trying to solve this by
providing a transparent SSH interface.

In order to use `clustermq` from your local machine, the package needs to be
installed on both there and on the computing cluster. On the computing cluster,
[set up your
scheduler](https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq/wiki#setting-up-the-scheduler)
and make sure `clustermq` runs there without problems. On your local machine,
add the following options in your `~/.Rprofile`:

```r
options(
    clustermq.scheduler = "ssh",
    clustermq.ssh.host = "user@host", # use your user and host, obviously
    clustermq.ssh.log = "~/cmq_ssh.log" # log for easier debugging
)
```

We recommend that you [set up SSH keys](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server) for password-less login.

## Usage

### The `Q` function

The following arguments are supported by `Q`:

 * `fun` - The function to call. This needs to be self-sufficient (because it
        will not have access to the `master` environment)
 * `...` - All iterated arguments passed to the function. If there is more than
        one, all of them need to be named
 * `const` - A named list of non-iterated arguments passed to `fun`
 * `export` - A named list of objects to export to the worker environment

Behavior can further be fine-tuned using the options below:

 * `fail_on_error` - Whether to stop if one of the calls returns an error
 * `seed` - A common seed that is combined with job number for reproducible results
 * `memory` - Amount of memory to request for the job (`bsub -M`)
 * `n_jobs` - Number of jobs to submit for all the function calls
 * `job_size` - Number of function calls per job. If used in combination with
        `n_jobs` the latter will be overall limit
 * `chunk_size` - How many calls a worker should process before reporting back
        to the master. Default: every worker will report back 100 times total

The full documentation is available by typing `?Q`.

### Examples

The package is designed to distribute arbitrary function calls on HPC worker
nodes. There are, however, a couple of caveats to observe as the R session
running on a worker does not share your local memory.

The simplest example is to a function call that is completely self-sufficient,
and there is one argument (`x`) that we iterate through:

```{r}
fx = function(x) x * 2
Q(fx, x=1:3, n_jobs=1)
```

Non-iterated arguments are supported by the `const` argument:

```{r}
fx = function(x, y) x * 2 + y
Q(fx, x=1:3, const=list(y=10), n_jobs=1)
```

If a function relies on objects in its environment that are not passed as
arguments, they can be exported using the `export` argument:

```{r}
fx = function(x) x * 2 + y
Q(fx, x=1:3, export=list(y=10), n_jobs=1)
```

If we want to use a package function we need to load it on the worker using the
`pkg` argument or referencing it with `package_name::`:

```{r}
fx = function(x) {
    x %>%
        mutate(area = Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width) %>%
        head()
}
Q(fx, x=list(iris), pkgs="dplyr", n_jobs=1)
```

### As parallel `foreach` backend

The [`foreach`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=foreach) package provides an
interface to perform repeated tasks on different backends. While it can perform
the function of simple loops using `%do%`:

```{r}
library(foreach)
x = foreach(i=1:3) %do% sqrt(i)
```

it can also perform these operations in parallel using `%dopar%`:

```{r}
x = foreach(i=1:3) %dopar% sqrt(i)
```

The latter allows registering different handlers for parallel execution, where
we can use `clustermq`:

```{r}
clustermq::register_dopar_cmq(n_jobs=2, memory=1024) # this accepts same arguments as `Q`
x = foreach(i=1:3) %dopar% sqrt(i) # this will be executed as jobs
```

As [BiocParallel](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocParallel.html)
supports `foreach` too, this means we can run all packages that use `BiocParallel`
on the cluster as well via `DoparParam`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(BiocParallel)
register(DoparParam()) # after register_dopar_cmq(...)
bplapply(1:3, sqrt)
```

### With `drake`

The [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) package enables users to
define a dependency structure of different function calls, and only evaluate
them if the underlying data changed.

> drake — or, Data Frames in R for Make — is a general-purpose workflow manager
> for data-driven tasks. It rebuilds intermediate data objects when their
> dependencies change, and it skips work when the results are already up to
> date. Not every runthrough starts from scratch, and completed workflows have
> tangible evidence of reproducibility. drake also supports scalability,
> parallel computing, and a smooth user experience when it comes to setting up,
> deploying, and maintaining data science projects.

It can use `clustermq` to perform calculations as jobs:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(drake)
load_mtcars_example()
# clean(destroy = TRUE)
# options(clustermq.scheduler = "multicore")
make(my_plan, parallelism = "clustermq", jobs = 2, verbose = 4)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Debugging workers

Function calls evaluated by workers are wrapped in event handlers, which means
that even if a call evaluation throws an error, this should be reported back to
the main R session.

However, there are reasons why workers might crash, and in which case they can
not report back. These include:

* A segfault in a low-level process
* Process kill due to resource constraints (e.g. walltime)
* Reaching the wait timeout without any signal from the master process
* Probably others

In this case, it is useful to have the worker(s) create a log file that will
also include events that are not reported back. It can be requested using:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Q(..., log_file="/path/to.file")
```

Note that `log_file` is a template field of your scheduler script, and hence
needs to be present there in order for this to work. The default templates all
have this field included.

In order to log each worker separately, some schedulers support wildcards in
their log file names. For instance:

* LSF: `log_file="/path/to.file.%I"`
* Slurm: `log_file="/path/to.file.%a"`

Your scheduler documentation will have more details about the available
options.

When reporting a bug that includes worker crashes, please always include a log
file.

### SSH

Before trying remote schedulers via SSH, make sure that the scheduler works
when you first connect to the cluster and run a job from there.

If the terminal is stuck at

```
Connecting <user@host> via SSH ...
```

make sure that each step of your SSH connection works by typing the following
commands in your **local** terminal and make sure that you don't get errors or
warnings in each step:

```{sh eval=FALSE}
# test your ssh login that you set up in ~/.ssh/config
# if this fails you have not set up SSH correctly
ssh <user@host>

# test port forwarding from 54709 remote to 6687 local (ports are random)
# if the fails you will not be able to use clustermq via SSH
ssh -R 54709:localhost:6687 <user@host> R --vanilla
```

If you get an `Command not found: R` error, make sure your `$PATH` is set up
correctly in your `~/.bash_profile` and/or your `~/.bashrc` (depending on
your cluster config you might need either).

If you get a SSH warning or error try again with `ssh -v` to enable verbose
output.

If the forward itself works, set the following option in your `~/.Rprofile`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
options(clustermq.ssh.log = "~/ssh_proxy.log")
```

This will create a log file *on the remote server* that will contain any errors
that might have occurred during `ssh_proxy` startup.

If the `ssh_proxy` startup fails on your local machine with the error

```
Remote R process did not respond after 5 seconds. Check your SSH server log.
```

but the server log does not show any errors, then you can try increasing the
timeout:

```{r eval=FALSE}
options(clustermq.ssh.timeout = 10) # or a higher number
```

This can happens when your SSH startup template includes additional steps
before starting R, such as activating a module or conda environment.

## Environments

In some cases, it may be necessary to activate a specific computing environment
on the scheduler jobs prior to starting up the worker. This can be, for
instance, because *R* was only installed in a specific environment or
container.

Examples for such environments or containers are:

* [Bash module](http://modules.sourceforge.net/) environments
* [Conda](https://conda.io/) environments
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)/[Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) containers

It should be possible to activate them in the job submission script (i.e., the
template file). This is widely untested, but would look the following for the
[LSF](#LSF) scheduler (analogous for others):

```r
#BSUB-J {{ job_name }}[1-{{ n_jobs }}]  # name of the job / array jobs
#BSUB-o {{ log_file | /dev/null }}      # stdout + stderr
#BSUB-M {{ memory | 4096 }}             # Memory requirements in Mbytes
#BSUB-R rusage[mem={{ memory | 4096 }}] # Memory requirements in Mbytes
##BSUB-q default                        # name of the queue (uncomment)
##BSUB-W {{ walltime | 6:00 }}          # walltime (uncomment)

module load {{ bashenv | default_bash_env }}
# or: source activate {{ conda | default_conda_env_name }}
# or: your environment activation command
ulimit -v $(( 1024 * {{ memory | 4096 }} ))
CMQ_AUTH={{ auth }} R --no-save --no-restore -e 'clustermq:::worker("{{ master }}")'
```

This template still needs to be filled, so in the above example you need to
pass either

```r
Q(..., template=list(bashenv="my environment name"))
```

or set it via an *.Rprofile* option:

```r
options(
    clustermq.defaults = list(bashenv="my default env")
)
```

## Scheduler templates

### LSF {#LSF}

In your `~/.Rprofile` on your computing cluster, set the following options:

```{r eval=FALSE}
options(
    clustermq.scheduler = "lsf",
    clustermq.template = "/path/to/file/below"
)
```

The option `clustermq.template` should point to a LSF template file like the one below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#BSUB-J {{ job_name }}[1-{{ n_jobs }}]  # name of the job / array jobs
#BSUB-n {{ cores | 1 }}                 # number of cores to use per job
#BSUB-o {{ log_file | /dev/null }}      # stdout + stderr; %I for array index
#BSUB-M {{ memory | 4096 }}             # Memory requirements in Mbytes
#BSUB-R rusage[mem={{ memory | 4096 }}] # Memory requirements in Mbytes
##BSUB-q default                        # name of the queue (uncomment)
##BSUB-W {{ walltime | 6:00 }}          # walltime (uncomment)

ulimit -v $(( 1024 * {{ memory | 4096 }} ))
CMQ_AUTH={{ auth }} R --no-save --no-restore -e 'clustermq:::worker("{{ master }}")'
```

In this file, `#BSUB-*` defines command-line arguments to the `bsub` program.

* Memory: defined by `BSUB-M` and `BSUB-R`. Check your local setup if the
  memory values supplied are MiB or KiB, default is `4096` if not requesting
  memory when calling `Q()`
* Queue: `BSUB-q default`. Use the queue with name *default*. This will most
  likely not exist on your system, so choose the right name (or comment out
  this line with an additional `#`)
* Walltime: `BSUB-W {{ walltime }}`. Set the maximum time a job is allowed to
  run before being killed. The default here is to disable this line. If you
  enable it, enter a fixed value or pass the `walltime` argument to each
  function call. The way it is written, it will use 6 hours if no arguemnt is
  given.
* For other options, see [the LSF
  documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSETD4_9.1.2/lsf_command_ref/bsub.1.html)
  and add them via `#BSUB-*` (where `*` represents the argument)
* Do not change the identifiers in curly braces (`{{ ... }}`), as they are used
  to fill in the right variables

Once this is done, the package will use your settings and no longer warn you of
the missing options.

### SGE {#SGE}

In your `~/.Rprofile` on your computing cluster, set the following options:

```{r eval=FALSE}
options(
    clustermq.scheduler = "sge",
    clustermq.template = "/path/to/file/below"
)
```

The option `clustermq.template` should point to a SGE template file like the one below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#$ -N {{ job_name }}               # job name
#$ -q default                      # submit to queue named "default"
#$ -j y                            # combine stdout/error in one file
#$ -o {{ log_file | /dev/null }}   # output file
#$ -cwd                            # use pwd as work dir
#$ -V                              # use environment variable
#$ -t 1-{{ n_jobs }}               # submit jobs as array
#$ -pe {{ cores | 1 }}             # number of cores to use per job

ulimit -v $(( 1024 * {{ memory | 4096 }} ))
CMQ_AUTH={{ auth }} R --no-save --no-restore -e 'clustermq:::worker("{{ master }}")'
```

In this file, `#$-*` defines command-line arguments to the `qsub` program.

* Queue: `$ -q default`. Use the queue with name *default*. This will most
  likely not exist on your system, so choose the right name (or comment out
  this line with an additional `#`)
* For other options, see [the SGE
  documentation](http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/manuals.html). Do
  not change the identifiers in curly braces (`{{ ... }}`), as they are used to
  fill in the right variables.

Once this is done, the package will use your settings and no longer warn you of
the missing options.

### SLURM {#SLURM}

In your `~/.Rprofile` on your computing cluster, set the following options:

```{r eval=FALSE}
options(
    clustermq.scheduler = "slurm",
    clustermq.template = "/path/to/file/below"
)
```

The option `clustermq.template` should point to a SLURM template file like the
one below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/sh
#SBATCH --job-name={{ job_name }}
#SBATCH --partition=default
#SBATCH --output={{ log_file | /dev/null }} # you can add .%a for array index
#SBATCH --error={{ log_file | /dev/null }}
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu={{ memory | 4096 }}
#SBATCH --array=1-{{ n_jobs }}
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task={{ cores | 1 }}

ulimit -v $(( 1024 * {{ memory | 4096 }} ))
CMQ_AUTH={{ auth }} R --no-save --no-restore -e 'clustermq:::worker("{{ master }}")'
```

In this file, `#SBATCH` defines command-line arguments to the `sbatch` program.

* Queue: `SBATCH --partition default`. Use the queue with name *default*. This
  will most likely not exist on your system, so choose the right name (or
  comment out this line with an additional `#`)
* For other options, see [the SLURM
  documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html). Do not change the
  identifiers in curly braces (`{{ ... }}`), as they are used to fill in the
  right variables.

Once this is done, the package will use your settings and no longer warn you of
the missing options.

### PBS {#PBS}

In your `~/.Rprofile` on your computing cluster, use the PBS scheduler with the
default PBS template:

```{r eval=FALSE}
options(clustermq.scheduler = "pbs")
```

To customize your PBS template, set `clustermq.template`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
options(
    clustermq.scheduler = "pbs",
    clustermq.template = "/path/to/file/below"
)
```

The option `clustermq.template` should point to a PBS template file like the
one below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#PBS -N {{ job_name }}
#PBS -J 1-{{ n_jobs }}
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus={{ cores | 1 }}:mpiprocs={{ cores | 1 }}:mem={{ memory | 4096 }}MB
#PBS -l walltime={{ walltime | 12:00:00 }}
#PBS -o {{ log_file | /dev/null }}
#PBS -j oe

#PBS -q default

ulimit -v $(( 1024 * {{ memory | 4096 }} ))
CMQ_AUTH={{ auth }} R --no-save --no-restore -e 'clustermq:::worker("{{ master }}")'

```

In this file, `#PBS-*` defines command-line arguments to the `qsub` program.

* Queue: `#PBS-q default`. Use the queue with name *default*. This will most
  likely not exist on your system, so choose the right name (or comment out
  this line with an additional `#`)
* For other options, see the PBS documentation. Do not change the identifiers
  in curly braces (`{{ ... }}`), as they are used to fill in the right
  variables.

Once this is done, the package will use your settings and no longer warn you of
the missing options.

### Torque {#Torque}

In your `~/.Rprofile` on your computing cluster, use the Torque scheduler with 
the default Torque template, as provided by us:

```{r eval=FALSE}
options(clustermq.scheduler = "Torque")
```

To customize your Torque template, set `clustermq.template`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
options(
    clustermq.scheduler = "Torque",
    clustermq.template = "/path/to/file/below"
)
```

The option `clustermq.template` should point to a Torque template file like the
one below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#PBS -N {{ job_name }}
#PBS -l nodes={{ n_jobs }}:ppn={{ cores | 1 }},walltime={{ walltime | 12:00:00 }}
#PBS -o {{ log_file | /dev/null }}
#PBS -q default
#PBS -j oe

ulimit -v $(( 1024 * {{ memory | 4096 }} ))
CMQ_AUTH={{ auth }} R --no-save --no-restore -e 'clustermq:::worker("{{ master }}")'
```

In this file, `#PBS-*` defines command-line arguments to the `qsub` program.

* Queue: `#PBS -q default`. Use the queue with name *default*. This will most
  likely not exist on your system, so choose the right name (or comment out
  this line with an additional `#`)
* For other options, see the Torque documentation. Do not change the
  identifiers in curly braces (`{{ ... }}`), as they are used to fill in the
  right variables.

Once this is done, the package will use your settings and no longer warn you of
the missing options.
